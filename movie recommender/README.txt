THE MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

- Hi guys, i'm excited to see you here. This is a project i created as a part of my internship at Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd, It would be a part of my portfolio too.

- This movie recommender uses MovieLens dataset to predict the users preferences and recommend movies to them. 

- I have included the jupyter notebook file and all the datasets in this repository. feel free to use them 

- I created this recommender based on only the movie ratings and other hidden relatonships between movies and users. hence the credits and the links dataset is not used here. But if you can create a recommender using them, its totally awesome. 

- I recommend you to install fuzzywuzzy module using pip for avoising missing module errors

- This recommender uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to find the closely related movies. 

Thank you for viewing my project.
