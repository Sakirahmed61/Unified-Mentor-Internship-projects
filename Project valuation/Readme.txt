Hello guys!!! 

I'm feeling very happy to present you this Valuation project of some big companies in the world.

- This is another project done as a part of my internship in Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd

- The project is about Cleaning and visualizing many insights from the data as possible from the dataset

- The project was cleaned using python and visualized in python using Matplotlib and seaborn

- It might seem like a small project, but i had the challenge of cleaning the dataset and i got to inprove my analyzing skills from this one. 

- Feel free to check the step by step procedure in my jupyter notebook file and also you can get the cleaned dataset in csv and xlsx formats. 

- Thank you
