HELLO! i'm Sakir Ahmed.

This repository contains all the projects i had done as an Data Analyst in Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd for a duration of 2 months. 

- I have included all the jupyter noteook files, a single presentation file explaining all the projects combined, and all the source datasets in the folders.
- View the presentation on your system to enablle all animation effects and for proper visual.
- You cannot view the pptx normally. You have to PLAY the presentation since each and every element in the pptx is animated.

CREDITS:
- I thank Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd to provide me with this opportunity to showcase my skills as an intern
- I thank all the tutorials and explanatory videos out there for making me understand the concepts clearly.
- I hope you Like this presentation.

THANK YOU
